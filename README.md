In this research, we hypothesize that the distance of nearby amenities and the numbers of amenities can be used to predict housing sales price in Brooklyn. We use NYC OpenData to conduct the research. After the data preparation and EDA, we use regression models, classification models, and clustering models to test our hypothesis. The regression models have a low accuracy score which indicates that it is difficult to predict housing prices with the distance of nearby amenities, while the accuracy score of classification models is higher. That is to say, by using classification models, we can predict a range of housing prices. The accuracy score for clustering models is excellent, which means that we can use this model to predict housing prices and the location of the property by knowing the distance of nearby amenities and the number of amenities.
